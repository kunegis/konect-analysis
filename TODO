repulsion, better than the absolute value, which models antipodal
attraction.  This is used in [357] to draw signed graphs. 
** decomposition: L= D-A without absolute value
** Is there always an eigenvalue zero with constant eigenvector?
** Eigenvalues may be negative even if every node has positive
sum-of-weights.

assigning a number to each node such that the number is equal/opposite
when two nodes are connected, and the algebraic conflict equals the sum
of squared differences.  Normalize by the number of edges, and such that
the mean square of numbers is one.
\xi' = \xi * n / 2m = \xi / d
(the exact definition is in projects/konect/presentations/komepol.opd)
* scatter over all nodes of one network:  degree vs number of adjacent

  and reduced to 100x100 blocks, in blsck and white 
* Fourier transform of timestamps for temporal networks
** for each T, map timestamps to interval [0,1} via (mod T), and measure
   the skewness of the resulting distribution. I.e., largest ratio
   between one half of the interval to another (using any split).  This
   is a form of the Kolgomorov-Smirnov distance between the actual
   distribution and the uniform distribution 
** X axis:  time scale, logarithmically from 1s to several years.  Y
   axis:   skewness.

* c/ifub.c:  at each step, use a timer-like progress indicator.  Same
  for triangles.c.

needed by dat/pa.wikilens-ratings.mat

  information as metadata in each m/konect_statistic_$statistic.m file
  separately

distribution), compute sigma^2/mu. [Four Degrees of Separation,
WebSci'12]   
* new statistic:  SPID (shortest-path index of dispersion) [708].  
* comparison:  use a scale in which the luminosity increases
continuously and the hue rotates around the colors.  
* new centrality measure:   C(i) = \sum_{j~i} d(i)^{-1}, where d(i) is the degree.
 For directed networks, use the indegree and the out-neighbors. 
* degree plots: have more and smaller ticks, even when no number is printed.
* closeness and betweenness centralities as node distributions
* New directed Laplacians:  L_out = D_out - A ; L_in = D_in - A. 
** Eigenvalues should be nonnegative according to r. braun 
** Send results to rosemary braun <rosemary.braun@gmail.com>
* degree: also plot as semilogY (to visualize exponential distributions) 
* for all decompositions:  use callback instead of prepare_matrix for
computation (uses less memory) 
* animated plots over time
* new distribution:  normalized degree, i.e. sum(A D^-1, 2) or sum(D^-1 A, 1). 
* new statistic:  geometrical dimension of a network. Sum_k (λ_1/λ_k)
with Laplacian eigenvalues.  
* check out scatter plots involving AREDIS.  What was the argument again
why a shrinking AREDIS is better/worse than a shrinking DIAMETER.  
* statistic time plots:  horizontal grid lines 
* inspect RADIUS of networks and add it as a statistic to the website 
* decomposition.b.stoch2 : axes:  Y_max should be 1.

/ log(degree)), such that row sums equal the log node degrees 
* nonnegative matrix decompositions
* decompositions with missing values [Y. Koren et al.; Matrix
factorization techniques for recommender systems]  
* probabilistic models:  LDA, PLSA, etc.
* distr:  use luinc() instead of lu()
* distr:  use dynamic bins

adjacency matrix, and multiply by the degree product afterwards 
* path:  for bipartite graphs, find equivalents of the local prediction
measures (i.e. number of common neighbors, Jaccard, etc.) 
* find a variant of preferential attachment that works on weighted

* implement the 4-clustering coefficient for bipartite graphs
(references are in [bipartivity]) 
* implement the statistic of [680] 
* gini vs jain:  although the scatter plots indicate that the measures
correlate negatively (which corresponds to their definition), their time
evolution has them both increasing.  In other words, "jain" should be
decreasing over time, but is increasing. 
* edge multiplicity distributions:  also the cumulated distribution
plots (show them on the website)  
* statistic:  variance of the degree distribution 
* distribution of common neighbors of all connected nodes (Hans Akkermans)

distribution (lognormal).  Go from a power law to a lognormal by
convolutions (consider the number of paths of length 2).  Go from
lognormal to power law by sums of lognormals (consider the eigenvalue
decomposition). 
* compute both types of clustering coefficient:  weighted by nodes, and
weighted by half-edges.  (only one is used at the moment, but the second
one can be derived trivially from the clustering coefficient
distribution) 
* relative clustering coefficient (relative to that of a random graph
with same size and volume) (i.e., divide by the fill) 
* power law:  measure distance to power law instead of statistical significance. 
** measure power law exponent in function of degree (using a kernel?)

* extend ANTICONFLICT to signed graphs, giving a statistic similar to
CONFLICT, but that is normalized by network size, and thus can be used
to compare networks.  Check whether, in signed/rating networks that
change over time, the new measure grows or shrinks, validating or
invalidating balance theory.  Cf. [797]. 
* compute the moments (number of cycles of length R) empirically from medium-sized networks.  
* connected component distribution plot:  for each size N, the
probability that a randomly chosen connected component of a network has
size ≥ N.  On a log-log plot.   Should exhibit a power-law for small N,
and a big outlier for the connected component [PEGASUS: A Peta-Scale
Graph Mining System - Implementation and Observations].
* weight power law exponent as a new statistic
* statistic only for directed acyclid graphs:  length of the longest
path
* statistic:  Soffer-Vasquez clustering coefficient and transitivity
$\tilde C$ and $\tilde T$ [b845]. 
* oddcycles:  This is implemented wrongly for signed networks.  It
should be based on the unsigned adjacency matrix, not on the signed
one.  For instance wikisigned-k2 has a negative value of the statistic now, which
it should not have. 
* maxdegree:  at the moment does not into account multiple edges (except for POSITIVE networks in which they are aggregated), but should
* local sparsity plot:  for each integer k, the average fill of the
k-ego-network, where the k-ego-network of a node is defined as the
network consisting of that node and its neighbors at distance at most
k.   The first entry of the plot is the clustering coefficient; the last
entry is the fill of the total network. 
* directed distance distribution 
* [gp32] triangle closing coefficient:  percentage of edges created by
triangles closing (as opposed to preferential attachment)
** Already implemented in briclo 
* julia-like map of generated synthetic graphs on the two-dimensional map 
* for transparent plots:  http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-export-fig
* The harmonic mean distance between nodes:
ohttp://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/000835
* sg1:  make the *_adj arrays have length n+1, where the last entry
  always equals m, to simplify iteration over all edges.  
* sg1:  for SYM, have an additional variant where each edge is only
  saved once (will make programs such as hyperanf and matrix
  decompositions use half of memory).
