Follow these steps to run the KONECT Analysis. 

We'll assume you will put all code in the ~/work/ directory, and all
data in the ~/data/ directory.  Change these paths accordingly in the
following instructions, if necessary.

(0) Install needed software

You will need software such as a C99 compiler, perl5, and others.  You
can install them at this point, or later when you notice that you need
them.  Not all are needed, so you may get away with not installing them.  

(1) Create directories 

First, create the necessary directories:

$ mkdir ~/work
$ mkdir ~/data

(2) Get konect-analysis/ and konect-toolbox/ from Github

Get the newest version of the konect-analysis and konect-toolbox
software package from Github.  Do this:

$ cd ~/work/
$ git clone https://github.com/kunegis/konect-analysis
$ git clone https://github.com/kunegis/konect-toolbox

(3) Create uni/

Create a directory named uni/ somewhere on your system that contains the
network datasets that you want to analyse:

$ mkdir ~/data/uni

For each network dataset, there must be two files in the uni/ directory: 

        out.$network
	meta.$network

where $network is the name of the network.  For instance, if your
network is named 'enron', you need the files 'out.enron' and
'meta.enron'.  The out.* file contains the network itself (it's a big
file), and the meta.* contains metadata (it's a small file).

If you analyse datasets from KONECT, you can get the files on the KONECT
website by following the "TSV" download link.  For instance, you can get
the files for the 'enron' dataset at

http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/networks/enron

If you want to analysis your own dataset, you must create these two
files for each of your dataset.  These exact format of these two files
is described in the KONECT Handbook, in Section 9 (File Formats).  The
KONECT Handbook is available here:

http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/downloads/konect-handbook.pdf

(4) Create plot/ and dat/

Somewhere on your system, create empty directories named plot/ and
dat/.  These directories will later contain the result of the analysis
by KONECT.  Since the result of the analysis may be large, you should
put them on a disk with enough free space.

plot/ will contain all plots created by KONECT Analysis, and dat/ all
data files created by KONECT Analysis.

For instance, do:

$ mkdir ~/data/plot
$ mkdir ~/data/dat

(4) Connect directories to KONECT Analysis

Use 'ln -s' to link the three directories to konect-analysis/.  While in
the directory konect-analysis/, do

$ cd ~/work/konect-analysis/
$ ln -s ~/work/konect-toolbox ./
$ ln -s ~/data/plot ./
$ ln -s ~/data/dat ./
$ ln -s ~/data/uni ./

(5) [OPTIONAL] Install Matlab-BGL

See lib/README for full instructions.  Short version:  Download
Matlab-BGL version 4.x from

http://www.stanford.edu/~dgleich/programs/matlab_bgl/

and unpack it in the ~/work/konect-analysis/lib/ directory.  There
should now be a directory ~/work/konect-analysis/lib/matlab_bgl/
containing Matlab-BGL.

(6) Install Stu

$ cd ~/work/
$ git clone https://github.com/kunegis/stu/
$ cd stu
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

You need G++ to compile Stu, in a version that supports C++11. 

(7) [OPTIONAL] Other libraries 

Install libraries as described in lib/README.  Not all targets need
extra libraries.  You may as well don't do it and wait until you get a
corresponding error message.  

(8) Run the analysis

Execute:

$ cd ~/work/konect-analysis/

Optionally, you can now setup the maximum amount of memory (i.e., RAM)
that KONECT will use.  You should do this if you intend to use very
large datasets.  Do this:

$ ulimit -v 67108864

You should replace the number '67108864' by the size of your memory in
kilobyte.  The given example is thus correct if you have 64 GiB of
memory. 

Now, run KONECT Analysis:

$ nice ./mns [K] <TARGET>

where <TARGET> is the target to run.  For a full list of possible
targets, see the file 'main.stu'.

[K] is optional and is the number of processes to run in parallel.
Thus, if you want to run eight processes in parallel, use 'nice ./mns 8 ...'. 

Examples for <TARGET> are:

@network.enron

	Compute everything for the network named 'enron'.  This will
	read the files uni/out.enron and uni/meta.enron and write
	analyses of that network into dat/ and plot/.  plot/ will
	contain plots computed for the network, and dat/ numerical
	analyses. 

@network.$network

	Compute everything for the given network named $network. 

@statistic.triangles.enron

	Compute the number of triangles in the 'enron' dataset.  The
	result will be written in the file
	~/data/dat/statistic.triangles.enron (the first line in that
	file is the number of triangles)

@statistic.$statistic.$network

	where $statistic is the name of statistic, and $network is the
	name of a network.  This will compute the given statistic for
	the given network.  The possible statistics are described in the
	KONECT Handbook in Section 4 (Statistics).  The value of the
	statistic will be written in the first line of the file
	~/data/dat/statistic.$statistic.$network

@statistic.$statistic

	Compute the given statistic for all networks

Many more targets are described in 'main.stu'.
